# Unity-Robot-Competition-Script

This script placed my digital robot second out of 20 in a capture the flag style robot tournament held in class at the University of British Columbia. Robots faced off 1v1 attempting to capture the most balls from the center of the arena while exchanging lazer fire which if hit, would result in paralysis. The robot who held the most balls in base at clock expiry won.
